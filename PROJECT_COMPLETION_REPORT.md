### ✅ PHASE 2: CAPTION REVOLUTION

- Family: "Perfect Family Safe Haven" with kid-focused benefits (vs generic)
- Luxury: "Status & Comfort Combined - Turn Heads Everywhere" (vs "Premium Features")

### ✅ PHASE 3: PSYCHOLOGICAL SELLING ANGLES

### ✅ PHASE 4: HASHTAG STRATIFICATION

- **New System**: 30 conversion-focused hashtags in 10 tiers:
  1. Core intent (buyer searching)

  3. Category/motivation (buyer psychology)
  4. Price positioning (financial segmentation)
  5. Mileage/condition (quality signals)
  6. Transmission type (convenience)
  7. Engine power (performance)
  8. Year (recency)
  9. Location (geography)

Each scenario includes:
